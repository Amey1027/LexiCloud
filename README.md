# LexiCloud
A legal drafting app built with React, Vite, TypeScript, Tailwind, and Supabase.
LexiCloud is an AI-powered legal drafting and compliance platform built using Google Cloud Generative AI technologies. It assists lawyers, firms, and startups in generating legally sound contracts, agreements, and notices tailored to Indian laws. The system not only drafts documents through natural language prompts but also validates each clause using its unique Law & Clause Intelligence Engine, which cross-references current Indian statutes and case precedents in real time. By integrating Vertex AI, BigQuery, and Document AI, LexiCloud ensures accuracy, transparency, and efficiency in legal workflows—reducing manual effort while enhancing compliance, risk detection, and accessibility for legal professionals and businesses.
